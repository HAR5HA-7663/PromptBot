## Our Goal

The goal of **PromptBot** is to develop a robotic system that interprets natural language commands, such as ‚ÄúPick up the red shoes,‚Äù and autonomously executes the corresponding actions. This project brings together modules for natural language processing, computer vision, and robotic control.

## What PromptBot Does

PromptBot can receive natural language instructions, parse the command, identify relevant objects using vision, and use robotic control to interact with them. The system leverages open-source modules like ROS and NLP libraries while integrating custom logic for task execution.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understanding natural language processing for command parsing.
- Using vision/perception to identify objects in a scene.
- Controlling robot motion and manipulation via ROS.
- Integrating modules to enable command-based task execution.
- Creating an architecture diagram for complex robotic systems.
- Collaborating and managing tasks across team members.

## Project Structure and Modules

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module**: Uses spaCy or NLTK to parse commands and identify tasks and target objects.
- **Vision/Perception Module**: Utilizes OpenCV or ROS-based vision libraries to detect and localize objects.
- **Robotic Control Module**: Uses ROS to execute movement and interaction tasks based on parsed commands.
- **Custom Task Planning Module**: Integrates NLP and perception data to plan robot actions.

## Team Members

- **Khalil Khalaf** - Vision and perception.
- **Sri Vishal Kotari** - Natural language processing and command integration.
- **V Harsha Vardhan Yellela** - Robotic control and overall architecture.

>This project was developed as part of our Robotics and AI curriculum, utilizing cutting-edge approaches from "ForceSight" and "ProgPrompt" research papers.
